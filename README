User Space Accelerator Development Kit
======================================

UADK is a framework for user application to access hardware accelerator in a
unified, secure, and efficient way. UADK is comprised of UACCE, libwd and many
other algorithm libraries for different applications.

UADK contains the following elements:

wd.c
	UADK fundamental library which wraps the basic operations to the UACCE
	device. libwd is this library.

wd_[alg].c
	UADK algorithm libraries. libwd_comp is for compression/decompression,
	libwd_crypto is for all encryption/decryption and hash algorithm.

wd_utils.[ch]
	Some utility functions used by UADK and its drivers.

drv/*
	Hardware drivers. It helps to fulfill the semantic of algorithm
	libraries for particular hardware.

test/*
	Test applications to use UADK.

include/*
	Head files for user APP and hardware drivers.

docs/*
	Documentations.

======================================

The information of deploying UADK is in INSTALL file.

The design document is in docs/wd_design.md file.

The rules of library version are in docs/maintenance.md file.
