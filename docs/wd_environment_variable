Define WD related environment variables
=======================================

-v0.1 2021.3.29 Sherlock         Init
-v0.2 2021.4. 1 Barry, Sherlock  Remove driver, sched, async polling env

Currently WD lib offers init related APIs to init accelerator resources in
one process. User should call libwd and libwd_comp/libwd_crypto APIs to do
this. WD lib could help to do this by parsing a set of WD configurations
set by user. This document defines this set of WD environment variables to
offer process level WD configures.

1. WD environment variables define
==================================

WD_<alg>_ASYNC_POLL_EN
----------------------

 Define if enble polling threads in WD. WD_<alg>_ASYNC_POLL_EN=1 means enable
 polling threads in WD, otherwise caller should poll finished request by
 WD APIs.

WD_COMP_CTX_NUM
-----------------

 Define the algorithm ctx number. For example:
 WD_COMP_CTX_NUM=sync-comp:10@0,async-decomp:20@1 means 10 sync ctxs are used
 for compression in node0, and 20 async ctxs are used for decompression in
 node1.

 currently, we only have:
 <sync-comp|sync-decomp|async-comp|async-decomp>:<num>@<node>

WD_<alg>_CTX_NUM
-----------------

 Define the algorithm ctx number. For example:
 WD_<alg>_CTX_NUM=sync:10@0,async:20@1 means 10 sync ctxs are used
 in node0, and 20 async ctxs are used in node1.

alg above could be CIPHER, AEAD, DIGEST, DH, RSA, ECC.

WD_<alg>_ASYNC_POLL_NUM
-----------------------

 Define the async polling thread numbers in NUMA node. For example:
 WD_<alg>_ASYNC_POLL_NUM=2@0,4@2 means to configure 2 async polling threads in
 node0, and 4 polling threads in node2.
