Define WD related environment variables

Currently WD lib offers init related APIs to init accelerator resources in
one process. User should call libwd and libwd_comp/libwd_crypto APIs to do
this. WD lib could help to do this by parsing a set of WD configurations
set by user. This document defines this set of WD environment variables to
offer process level WD configures.

1. WD environment variables define
==================================

WD_<alg>_NUMA
-------------

 Define which uacce device to be used. The NUMA nodes are separated by commas.
 For example: WD_<alg>_NUMA=0, WD_<alg>_NUMA=1,2,3

WD_<alg>_SYNC_CTX_NUM
---------------------

 Define the sync ctx number in NUMA node. For example:
 WD_<alg>_SYNC_CTX_NUM=10@0,30@2 means to configure 10 sync ctxs in node0, and
 30 sync ctxs in node2.

WD_<alg>_ASYNC_CTX_NUM
----------------------

 Define the async ctx number in NUMA node. For example:
 WD_<alg>_ASYNC_CTX_NUM=10@0,30@2 means to configure 10 async ctxs in node0, and
 30 async ctxs in node2.

WD_<alg>_ASYNC_POLL_EN
----------------------

 Define if enble polling threads in WD. WD_<alg>_ASYNC_POLL_EN=1 means enable
 polling threads in WD, otherwise caller should poll finished request by
 WD APIs.

WD_<alg>_CTX_TYPE
-----------------

 Define the algorithm operation type of a group of ctxs. For example:
 WD_<alg>_CTX_TYPE=sync-comp:10@0,async-decomp:20@1 means 10 sync ctxs are used
 for compression in node0, and 20 async ctxs are used for decompression in
 node1.

 currently, we only have:
 <sync-comp|sync-decomp|async-comp|async-decomp>:<num>@<node>

alg above could be COMP, CIPHER, AEAD, DIGEST, DH, RSA, ECC. alg in
WD_<alg>_CTX_TYPE is only COMP as other algorithms do not need ctx type.

2. User model
